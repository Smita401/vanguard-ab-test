_Uncovering insights from Vanguard's digital experiment to assess the effectiveness of UI and in-context prompts in enhancing client engagement._

# Vanguard CX Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Vanguard Customer Experience (CX) Data Analysis Project! This repository contains the analysis and findings of a digital experiment conducted by the CX team at Vanguard, a US-based investment management company.

## Project Overview
As newly employed data analysts in the CX team, we've been tasked with analyzing the results of an exciting digital experiment. Prior to our arrival, the team launched this experiment to explore the impact of UI enhancements and in-context prompts on client engagement during online processes.

## The Digital Challenge
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, Vanguard recognizes the importance of enhancing the online experience for its clients. The experiment aimed to determine whether a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts, could streamline the online process and encourage more clients to complete their tasks.

### Key Questions
The critical question driving this project was:
_"Would the implementation of these changes lead to increased client engagement and completion rates of online processes?"_
